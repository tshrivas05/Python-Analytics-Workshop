# Python-Analytics-Workshop
This project involved creating a basic and easy-to-understand workbook using Python Analytics (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib). 
In this workbook, we explore a dataset sourced from Kaggle that documented the Netflix catalog as of November 2019. To analyze the Netflix data, we used masking in order to create smaller dataframes to inspect subsets of the greater data. We used string methods in order to cleanse the time data and used pandas functions to conduct some exploratory analysis.

This notebook was co-written by Trisha Shrivastava (Data Processing portion) and Kunal Jain (Data Visualizations portion).
